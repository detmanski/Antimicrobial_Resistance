### Project Proposal
We have decided to choose the topic of the healthcare industry to explore one of the major threats to the worldwide human health focusing on the analysis of the bacterial antimicrobial resistance (AMR). The aim of our project is to uncover patterns and tends in AMR across different parts of the world. The goals of undertaken this project are to answer some important questions related to AMR. We would like to demonstrate which bactria is the most prevalent in terms of drug resistance, what are the global regions most affected by AMR, and which germs are the most frequently found as well as have the worst symptoms.
