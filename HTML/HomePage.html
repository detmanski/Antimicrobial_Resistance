      <h1>Bacterial Antimicrobial Resistance (AMR)</h1>
      <h2>What is it?</h2>
      <p>AMR poses a major threat to human health around the world and we are facing a health crisis as many drugs we have commonly used are no longer effective and we struggle to find new treatments to combat infections.
        It is a growing threat which is exacerbated by overuse of antibiotics as well as poor waste management and climate change. 
        AMR occurs when microbes (bacteria, fungi, parasites and viruses) evolve over time so that antimicrobial drugs that previously worked against them are no longer effective.
        As a result of this drug resistance, infections spread and become harder to treat.
